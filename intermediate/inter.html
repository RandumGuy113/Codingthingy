  <h3 class="whiteopening">Queens Gambit.</h3>
  <img src="openingsimgs/queengambitopening.png" class="wgo">
  <p class="explainwhitegambit">
    The Queens Gambit is a solid opening, because the pawn sacrificed can be taken later by the bishop on F1 when you move the pawn on the E file 2 spaces.
    If black takes pawn on c4, white pawn moves from e2 to e4, with discovered attack on the black c4 pawn, also taking control of the center. 
    Now, if black declines the gambit by playing pawn to e6, just go Nf3, taking partial control of the center.

  <h3 class="whiteopening">Kings Gambit.</h3>
  <img src="openingsimgs/kinggambitopening.png" class="wgo">
  <p class="explainwhitegambit">
    The Kings Gambit is the flipped version of the Queens Gambit, which starts with e4, e5, and f4, gambiting a pawn for either center use or something else.
    Usually, people take the pawn, accepting the gambit. Then, white usually plays d4, taking control of the center and threatening to take back the pawn.
    The opponent usually responds with f5, threatening a pawn, or g5, protecting the pawn.

  <h3 class="blackopening">The Caro-Kann defense.</h3>

  <p class="explainblackopening">
    This one is noted by GothamChess to be a great one, since it leads to great endgames if you play good enough. Many grandmasters play this since they are great at endgames.
    Notably the no longer master Magnus Carlsen being great at endgames. Most newbies don't know how to play carokann, but if they do, good luck surviving.
