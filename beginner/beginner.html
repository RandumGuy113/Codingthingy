  <h1>The pieces in chess, described.</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>King</h3>
  <p>
    The King is the only untakeable piece in orthodox chess, as the opponent is the one trying to corner and attack it, with no possible escape.
    That is called "checkmate", there is also stalemate, where the opponent cannot move, but not in check.

  <h3>Queen</h3>  
  <p>The Queen is the second strongest piece, being able to move like a rook and a bishop at the same time.</p>

  <h3>The bishops.</h3>
  <p>The bishops are the pieces that can only move diagaonally on their square indefinitely, and the players are given a white squared and black squared one.</p>

  <h3>The knights</h3>
  <p>The knights are very useful, as they can move over pieces and they move in L shapes, allowing the player to fork pieces.</p>

<h3>The rooks</h3>
<p>The rooks move horizontally and vertically, and they have a special move with the king, and it's called Castling.</p>

<h3>The pawns.</h3>
<p>At their starting file, usually the 2nd rank, they can "boost" themselves, moving 2 squares, or just move one.
    After that, it's just 1 square per turn. They move forward only, but they attack 1 square diagonally in front of them.
